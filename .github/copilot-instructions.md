# Instructions for Copilot

## Project overview

This project is a GPT library to enable accessing and modifying a partition table and resizing partitions.

## LLM response language

Do not act friendly. Do not give praise. Do not use exclamation marks. Keep your commentary technical and to the point.

## Code style

Do not write comments indicating what you have changed. For example, if I ask you to remove some code, DO NOT put a comment as a placeholder for the deleted code. It is intended to be gone and forgotten. Old code lives in git history, not code comments.

Do not write comments for obvious things like imports or variables. If you are calling a function called run_dhcp(), there is no need for a comment above it to say "// Run DHCP". Make the code speak for itself as much as possible. Comments may be used for things with some nuance that may not be obvious from reading the code itself. When comments are used, explain the why, not the what.
